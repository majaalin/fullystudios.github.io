  <h3>Digital producer – with client & project management skills.</h3>

  <p>We are looking for someone with a skillset in managing and caring for clients, projects and the team. You probably have a background within digital experiences, either from a product or an agency perspective. The responsibilities as a Digital Producer include resource planning, budgeting and supporting your team with creative input and feedback. Since our services are digital in nature, hopefully, you are too. If you have previous experience in producing video that’s a huge plus, but not a requirement.</p>

  <p>Sounds like fun? Send your application to <a href="mailto:john.rejnas@fullystudios.se">john.rejnas@fullystudios.se</a> and we’ll be in touch!</p>

High and low, fast or slow – you enjoy challenging projects mixed with day-to-day tasks. This role requires a bit of flexibility and self-initiative, but hey, whenever you need help you are surrounded by friends.</p>
